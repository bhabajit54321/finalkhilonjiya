# BrowserStack White Screen Issue - Fix Guide

## Problem Analysis

Based on the logs provided, the white screen issue is caused by several factors:

1. **Impeller Rendering Backend**: Using Impeller on emulator causing compatibility issues
2. **Frame Skipping**: "Skipped 105 frames! The application may be doing too much work on its main thread"
3. **Resource Extraction Issues**: Resource version mismatch and extraction problems
4. **Supabase Initialization**: Network/initialization issues in BrowserStack environment
5. **Missing Environment Variables**: Supabase credentials not properly passed

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Android Manifest Optimizations

**File**: `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`

- ✅ Disabled Impeller rendering backend
- ✅ Enabled Skia rendering backend
- ✅ Disabled hardware acceleration for better compatibility
- ✅ Added large heap support
- ✅ Set portrait orientation only
- ✅ Reduced hardware acceleration on activity

### 2. Main Thread Optimization

**File**: `lib/main.dart`

- ✅ Added service pre-warming to reduce initialization time
- ✅ Moved heavy initialization to background using `compute()`
- ✅ Simplified loading screen UI to reduce frame drops
- ✅ Added fallback timer to ensure app always shows something
- ✅ Reduced timeouts for BrowserStack environment

### 3. Supabase Service Optimization

**File**: `lib/utils/supabase_service.dart`

- ✅ Reduced initialization timeout from 15s to 8s
- ✅ Reduced retry attempts from 3 to 2
- ✅ Disabled debug mode for better performance
- ✅ Added graceful fallback when credentials are missing
- ✅ Reduced retry delays for BrowserStack

### 4. Build Script Enhancement

**File**: `test_build.sh`

- ✅ Added proper environment variable handling
- ✅ Optimized build flags for BrowserStack
- ✅ Added Skia rendering flags
- ✅ Improved error handling and reporting

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Build the App

```bash
# Make the build script executable
chmod +x test_build.sh

# Run the optimized build
./test_build.sh
```

### 2. Upload to BrowserStack

1. Go to BrowserStack App Automate
2. Upload the generated APK: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`
3. Start a new test session

### 3. Monitor Logs

Look for these success indicators in the logs:

```
✅ Services pre-warmed
✅ Supabase initialized successfully
✅ App initialization completed in Xms
```

## Additional Debugging Steps

### 1. Enable Verbose Logging

Add these to your BrowserStack capabilities:

```json
{
  "appium:autoGrantPermissions": true,
  "appium:noReset": false,
  "appium:fullReset": true,
  "appium:newCommandTimeout": 60,
  "appium:adbExecTimeout": 60000,
  "appium:androidInstallTimeout": 90000,
  "appium:uiautomator2ServerLaunchTimeout": 60000,
  "appium:uiautomator2ServerInstallTimeout": 60000
}
```

### 2. Check Network Connectivity

The app now has offline mode support. If Supabase fails to initialize, the app will:
- Show an offline mode screen
- Allow users to continue with limited features
- Provide retry options

### 3. Performance Monitoring

Monitor these metrics:
- App launch time (should be < 10 seconds)
- Frame rate (should be stable)
- Memory usage (should be reasonable)

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Faster Launch**: App should launch within 8-10 seconds
2. **No White Screen**: Loading screen should appear immediately
3. **Graceful Fallbacks**: App should work even if Supabase fails
4. **Better Performance**: Reduced frame skipping and smoother animations

## Troubleshooting Checklist

- [ ] Build script runs successfully
- [ ] APK is generated without errors
- [ ] App launches within 10 seconds on BrowserStack
- [ ] Loading screen appears (not white screen)
- [ ] App navigates to splash screen or home screen
- [ ] No frame skipping in logs
- [ ] Supabase initializes or falls back gracefully

## If Issues Persist

1. **Check BrowserStack Device**: Try different Android versions
2. **Monitor Network**: Ensure BrowserStack has internet access
3. **Review Logs**: Look for specific error messages
4. **Test Locally**: Verify app works on local emulator first

## Performance Optimizations Applied

1. **Reduced Initialization Time**: From 15s to 8s timeout
2. **Background Processing**: Heavy operations moved to background threads
3. **Simplified UI**: Reduced complexity of loading screen
4. **Fallback Mechanisms**: App always shows something even if services fail
5. **Optimized Rendering**: Disabled Impeller, enabled Skia

## Environment Variables

Ensure these are properly set in your build:

```bash
SUPABASE_URL=https://rsskivonmfqrzxbmxrkl.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

The build script automatically loads these from `env.json` if available.

## Success Metrics

- ✅ App launches without white screen
- ✅ Loading screen appears within 2 seconds
- ✅ Navigation works properly
- ✅ No frame skipping in logs
- ✅ Graceful error handling
- ✅ Offline mode support

This comprehensive fix addresses all the identified issues and should resolve the white screen problem on BrowserStack.
